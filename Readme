A password generator project is a tool designed to create secure and random passwords for users. 
It typically allows users to customize their passwords by choosing the length and including options for uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. 
The goal is to enhance security by generating passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.
